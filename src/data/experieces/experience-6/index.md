As a full-stack developer at Sana Benefits, I created a healthcare plan selection feature using ReactJS, Jest, SASS, and Ruby on Rails. I also acted as an Agile Coach, teaching my team how to use Scrum effectively, and developed a standardized testing process for all engineering teams. Through collaboration with Lead Devs and Software Architects, I ensured that everyone was on the same page regarding testing different parts of our codebase.
