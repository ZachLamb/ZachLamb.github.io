  description: The problem with my resume was that it did not reflect my design skills , nor did it set me apart from my peers. I knew that a resume could not be too creative meaning hard to read ,so I knew that I needed to design an intuitive and familiar experience for my user/reviewer. I also knew that I wanted to give the user a unique experience. Something that they would have not experienced before with a resume. My solution was to follow the design of a public transportation map.
