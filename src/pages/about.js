              I am a driven front-end developer with extensive UX experience. I
              constantly leverage my UX background to create data-driven and

              constantly honing my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. Using
              cutting edge frameworks libraries, like React, is something Iâ€™m

              I joined my last company as a jr. developer. I struggled to keep up with client's ever changing demands and communication in my team. 
              As I have learned more about the Agile method along with my teammates, we have been empowered to adapt to those needs. Those hard lessons 
              have shown how important each Agile principle is. Through this, I have grown to become the Scrum Master and Agile Coach on my project teams.

              I grew up exploring the Rocky Mountains and learning how to be a

              volunteering too. I have helped organize hackathons in the past ,
              and I am actively involved with Code For America.
