  description: I was sending out applications to jobs with no luck of hearing back ,so I decided to redesign my resume to better reflect my design skills and usability skills. I began with the idea of making my resume creative but also intuitive. You will notice that my resume looks different yet familiar. Fun yet logical. I went through about 10 iterations of user testing to get my resume to where it is now.
