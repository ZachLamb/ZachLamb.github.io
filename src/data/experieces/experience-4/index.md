As a lead dev, I worked on various projects developing custom online learning experiences that won Brandon Hall Awards. I also contributed to the in house CMS that the company built using ReactJS and MobX. Since this company was more of a startup, I also acted as a Scrum Master and Technical Product Owner on various projects when needed.
